lync-productivity-timer
=======================

Productivity timer which allows you to work without interuption by automatically setting your Microsoft Lync availability to "Do Not Disturb" for a short while.

Works great with [Pomodoro](http://pomodorotechnique.com/) and other time management techniques.

## Requirements:

I'm using the following to develop the app:

* Microsoft Lync 2010
* [Microsoft Lync 2010 SDK](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=18898)
* Visual Studio 2010
* Windows 7

I'm unsure if this works with other versions - YMMV.
